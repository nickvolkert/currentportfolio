      <h1>Weekender</h1>
      <h2>These comics appears with comedy articles in the "Weekender" Section of the Northern Star, the student newspaper of Northern Illinois Univeristy, back in 2005-2006.</h2>

        <p>Original Print Date: 08/25/05</p>
        <p>This comic was about the sure-fire fashion statements of 2005: the popped collar, the reverse upside down visor, as well as a wish for more exposed naval on the ladies. Chris was also hoping someone would flip out and cover themselves in duct tape as a fashion statement. If you can't duct it...</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
       	<p>I did this comic with the idea of really pushing the boundaries of past comics I did for the paper. I was a bit nervous about having a ginourmous illustration of a naval for the inaugural comic to start my run as the Weekender cartoonist, but it went over well. I also had this idea to have a reference to the &quot;weekender&quot; section in all of the comics I did (which I eventually forgot about later as school got crazier as the year progressed). Check to belt buckle to see what I mean.</p>

        <p>Original Print Date: 08/25/05</p>
        <p>After spending the summer in a calm, vacant DeKalb IL, Brayton mused about the oncoming onslaught of Freshman and NIU college students converging on the NIU campus for yet another year of &quot;learning&quot; and drunken debauchery.</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>I did this comic really wanting to push myself. I was just starting to dabble with using grayscale in the comics I did for the Star this year. In the past I was making printouts on legal size paper which were scanned by the editor and placed on the page. I later moved over to burning the comics on a CD (and hoping they didn't get messed up in the disc to computer transit). I spent a crazy amount of time on this comic, really hoping to kick the door in for my first set of comics for the Weekender.</p>

        <p>Readers of the 'Struppendous Advice' were and inquiring bunch. This comic posed the question, what if the roommate that NIU hooked you up with in the dorms was actual a commie bastard-hell bent on blowing up the  cornfields in DeKalb.</p>

        <p>I give myself props for researching Rocky IV on the tee, (the Rocky when Stallone fights Dolf Lundgren). Choice. Upon discovery of the &quot;halftone effect&quot; I began using it as a background element in my comics.</p>

        <p>2005 marked the beginning of the palm pilot and gadget craze.  Brayton noticed the growing popularity of the device and pondered what the PDF of PDFs might be.</p>

        <p>Original Print Date: 09/08/05</p>
        <p>Beer:30 is a time that every college male observes on a daily basis, typically until the wee hours of the morning. In this edition of the &quot;Advice&quot; Strup ponders bailing on some sweet home cooking for some &quot;liquid refreshment of the Gods.&quot;</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>Struppendous advice usually had two to three &quot;questions&quot; per edition. As time progressed the comics I drew became more and more nonsensical as I tried to cover all of the bases visually. This illustration as as a stand alone image really needs to the article to compliment it, cause you'll never figure out what the hell is going on.</p>

        <p>Without effort, the ladies of our life can bring us to our knees with their wit and wisdom. This is about how a simple game of Battleship can become a metaphor of the day to life of a college relationship.</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>Chris never asked me to actually draw him in his own comics, but kind of wanted me to. This one I somehow nailed what his real-life girlfriend at the time looked like without actually meaning to (I never saw her or had him describe her to me in his life). Ironic. Oh yeah, the dude I drew in this comic looks nothing like Chris.</p>

        <p>Cheaters. Nobody likes em, but they are out there. This was about Brayton's dislike of the cheating few at NIU. Hey that rhymes, BOW DOWN.</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>There's a question as to wheter or not the dude is checking out the girl's answers, or the girl herself. I let that ambiguity slide. If you look closely, I had the girl draw my initials with in a &quot;heart with a line through it&quot; on her notebook. For the halftone pattern background I made all the circles in Adobe Illustrator and imported them into Photoshop cause I wanted them clean and crisp...because I'm anal retentive.</p>

        <p>This edition, a writer asks what could be the most elaborate prank to play on roommate who recently injured their leg. Chris' solution: turn the house into a set for your own personal production of &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot;</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>

        <p>Hurricanes had been inundating and destroying the southern part of the United States. Brayton's solution to the turmoil: a giant robotic hurricane fighting ferret (which would also keep the rabbit population in check). After conquering Mother Nature, it would logically have to go to Japan, and fight Godzilla.</p>

        <p>I remembered to give props to the Weekender in the mirror on the left, adding &quot;Weekender Mirror Co&quot; on the top of the frame of the mirror. Also, I actually ran into a guy that had a single antler growing out of his head. That's a comic based of life. True story.</p>

        <p>Original Print Date: 09/29/05</p>
        <p>Brayton, on another one of his trips on foot around DeKalb, found a feminie item. A tampon. So he decided to write an article about his thoughts on periods. </p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>Brayton's comic was always a challenge to draw for because he would always come up with so many things to portray visually. In this case, I had to think of a way to NOT portray thinks visually, cause I wanted to get the comic published and get paid like any other guy. So I came up with the idea of potraying the &quot;period&quot; as a strange occurance in a deep jungle, showing Brayton 'Indiana Jones' style. My attitude on this one was to draw my ass off, and hope that the high level of work would allow the comic to be published (since the column managed to get by the editor). And it did.</p>

      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>I spent too much time drawing this one, and didn't ink it. Partly cause I didn't want to hinder the art of the comic, mostly cause I was behind the 8-ball and needed to get it done. I thought it had a nice feel and changed it up from the past comics I drew.</p>

        <p>A reader ponders what to do when a woman with a backyard the size of a football field obstructs the aisle in the supermarket. The event which actually took place, was something similar to the &quot;Shining&quot; except a character with an ass like a shelf was in the cast.</p>

        <p>I wanted the comic to have that security cam feel, something like that &quot;been caught stealing&quot; video feel from Jane's Addiction, where the vid was filmed with a fish-eye lens.</p>

        <p>Nothing would be a better harbinger of death than the Canadian Goose. If Canada were to strike, we'd be taken off guard by those little stocking cap wearing geese. Aye?</p>

        <p>The Cell Phone provides great distractions when wanting to dodge and unwanted encounter, this comic takes is a bit further.</p>

        <p>When I showed Chris this illustration, he was a bit dumbfounded that I didn't use his definition of someone calling a person on their cellphone, and instead, dressed an oversized phone in drag.</p>

        <p>If you make a trip to NIU's Health Services you will be diagnosed for one of two ailments: mono, or pregnancy. This comic is about how Brayton went to the clinic with man-pregnancy.</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>I don't know if it called for it, but I thought having a nervous smoking germ was a nice touch. Brayton is in love with Scully from X-Files if you didn't pick up on it yet.</p>

        <p>One of Chris' fans wrote in a question that was more of a rant than a question about how certain professors try to drag class out past dismissal in a seeming attempt to keep the students around longer to avoid their own personal case of loneliness.</p>

        <p>On occasion the 'Weekender' would have celebrity interviews. In the past they've interviewed stars of Nickelodeon's &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; as well as &quot;Saved by the Bell.&quot; This interview they managed to get a hold of the star of the Nickelodeon show &quot;Alex Mack,&quot; Larisa Oleynik. Thinking it was going to be a smooth interview, things took a turn for the worse when the little phone recorder device they use to capture the interviews crashed and burned. Brayton then re-wrote the interview from his mind.</p>

        <p>Jones Soda Co. comes out with seasonal sodas that taste like treats from the Holidays. This installment was for the Turkey Day. By facial expression, Brayton's reaction is captured. Included as well are some holiday suggestions for additional sodas.</p>
      	<p class="imageTitle">Comic musings:</p>
        <p>I was pretty happy I emulated the &quot;Jones Soda&quot; look in this comic. The advisor at the Star was miffed at this comic because he felt it &quot;gave the joke away&quot; because I included the additional flavors Brayton later mentioned. Brayton really didn't care. Go fig.</p>

        <p>I drew this comic at like 5 AM cause I had this crazy class at the time that I needed to get a presentation done for. This comic took priority. 10,000 readers, or impressing 30 classmates for a grade, 10,000 readers...</p>

        <p>Brayton's final column was about cheese. Having no way to make a funny cheese related comic, I leaned on an old stand by: making fun of the Northern Europeans.</p>

        <p>This is my first and last appearance in one of my own comics for the Weekender section (I'm wearing the argyle stocking cap). Why? Because the Weekender was cut in the 2006 semester of the school year and replaced with the daily &quot;Flavor&quot; section. If you didn't read on the right, I drew this at 6 in the morning the day before it was printed, barely making it on time.</p>

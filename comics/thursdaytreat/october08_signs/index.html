<h2>You finally go over to her place and discover she has a trophy wall that is a bizarre enshrinement to the colossal douche bags she's dated in the past.</h2>
<h3><span class="worse">Worse Yet:</span> She had &quot;relations&quot; with <em>any</em> of these walking skid marks.</h3>
<h3><span class="last">Absolute Worst: </span>She <em>did</em> have &quot;relations&quot; with these bottom feeders before you knew of the existence of the "wall" and you had &quot;relations&quot; with her.</h3>

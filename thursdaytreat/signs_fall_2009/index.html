    <div class="text">You meet her family, and shudder in fear thinking of the possible, miserable, future get-togethers with them if you continue dating...<strong>it's prob not going to work out.</strong></div>
    <img src="images/2.jpg" width="700" height="461" />
    <div class="text">You think to yourself, "hmm, do I want to be seen in a photo with her that will be posted on Facebook for all of my friends/coworkers/family/x-girlfriends/classmates to see?"  If <strong>no, it's prob not going to work out.</strong></div>
    <img src="images/3.jpg" />
    <div class="text">You spend the night with her, and she <em>snores</em>, (you know, whatever, people snore), but her snore is <strong>EPIC</strong>, it sounds like she's on some kind of <strong>breathing apparatus</strong>, or is <strong>in</strong> an <strong>iron lung</strong>, kind of like <strong>Darth Vader</strong>...<strong>it's probably not going to work out.</strong></div>
    <img src="images/4.jpg" width="700" height="528" />
    <div class="text">When you reminisce about past dates/good times you've had together, she has a hard time remembering them because she was either <strong>too drunk</strong> or <strong>too stoned</strong> (or both), furthermore, she can barely function in public because she typically requires herself to be in an altered state...<strong>it's probably not going to work out.</strong></div>
    <img src="images/5.jpg" width="700" height="493" />
    <div class="text">You notice she gladly <strong>directs</strong> and <strong>dictates</strong> <strong>where</strong> and <strong>when</strong> you spend your <strong>money</strong>, (this hurts especially more if you're living paycheck to paycheck), Also she seldom <em>(or never)</em> pitches in on <strong>anything</strong>...<strong>it's probably not going to work out.</strong></div>

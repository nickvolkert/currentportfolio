Over </h2>      <p><a href="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/finally_over/index.htm"><img src="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/finally_over/images/promo.gif" width="471" height="151" border="0"></a></p>      <p>What has it been?  Like 2 full years of <strong>political fornication</strong> finally ending with a <strong>climax on Nov. 4th?</strong>  <a href="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/finally_over/index.htm">This week's thursday treat</a> is expression of my elation that it's <strong>FINALLY OVER.</strong>       <p>I admittedly I'm dissapointed with the outcome. Was it because my candidate wasn't elected? No. I wasn't elected. <a href="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/volkert_2008/index.html">Go here to relieve my day-long run for the White House.</a> It was an uphill battle. I didn't really have any support...or money, and I'm not 35 yet...but still. I want to thank everyone who wrote me on in the primary. See you in 2012.      </body></html>

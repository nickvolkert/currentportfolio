      <h1>Thursday Treat | Spring 2008</h1>
       <h2>Yeah, UMMM, What Is That? </h2>
       <a href="usuckatpicto/index.html"><img src="images/picto-promo.gif" width="468" height="144" border="0" /></a>
       <div class="datestamp">04/10/2008</div>
  <p>Yeah, uh, your drawing skills, <strong>not the best.</strong> Maybe you should doodle a bit
    more instead of playing all of those video games. <a href="usuckatpicto/index.html">See
    what I mean. </a></p>
       <h2>Spring, Road Salt, and Your Vehicle...</h2>
       <a href="saltyvehicle/index.html"><img src="images/saltypromo.jpg" width="468" height="200" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">04/02/2008</div>
        <p>Awwww yeah the Thursday Treat <strong>indeed</strong>. This one is
          auto-biographical. <a href="saltyvehicle/index.html">Check it out.</a> </p>
        <h2>Easter? Already? </h2>
       <a href="easter-2008/index.html"><img src="images/easter2008.gif" width="468" height="130" border="1" /></a>
       <div class="datestamp">03/20/08</div>
  <p>Yeah, it's Easter already, <strong>two weeks early</strong>. I don't know if it's such a good idea. <a href="easter-2008/index.html">See what I mean here.</a></p>
       <p>Don't forget to check out <a href="easter-050507/index.html">2007's Easter Treat</a>. While you're at it, check out <a href="easter_041306/index.html">2006's Easter Treat</a> as well. </p>
       <h2>St. Pats 2008 Edition </h2>
       <a href="stpats-2008/index.html"><img src="images/stpats-2008.gif" width="468" height="167" border="1" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">03/12/08</div>
          <p>Well it must be in or around <span class="style3">St. Pats</span> because
            I have it marked to make a cartoon celebrating the uh...celebration.
            It addresses overconsumption on the day, the following comic lets
             you know if you may have had too much. <a href="stpats-2008/index.html">Here
            it is</a> <span class="style2">(be
            careful)</span>. Also, because it is just as awesome, check out <a href="stpattys-041807/index.html">last
            years St. Pat's cartoon</a> (totally safe). </p>
	      <h2>When a Good Deed Takes a Wrong Turn </h2>
          <a href="worstcase/index.html"><img src="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/images/worstcase.gif" width="468" height="100" border="1" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">03/06/08</div>
  <p>Did you read that heart touching story of the sea turtle that got the artificial limb to get it back on its feet? Well this is about that, say if it somehow just went horribly horribly wrong. It's a little comic titled <a href="worstcase/index.html">&quot;Worst Case Scenario.&quot;</a></p>
      <p>*Editor's Note. Early feedback I got on this one I guess people are trying to read too much into it. Don't. It's just supposed to be random, a little nonsensical and of course stupid. Think of this one as waking up in the morning and not thinking it would end like that. Enjoy. </p>
      <h2>The Doc's a Bit of a Hard Ass These Days </h2>
      <a href="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/hardassdoctors" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/images/terrytooth.gif" border="1" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">02/28/08</div>
  <p>It's just that time a year when a dude has to make unusual amounts of trips
    for Dr.'s appointments, eye appointments, yearly check ups, you know, what
    have you. I noticed, while waiting for the doc, the little reminder posters
    have taken a bit of a hard ass approach. <a href="http://www.nickvolkert.com/thursdaytreat/hardassdoctors" target="_blank">Check
    out a couple I found.</a> </p>
      <h2>Gone Clean, Wholesome Fun, a Small Retrospective </h2>
      <a href="http://www.nickvolkert.com/syndication/index.htm" target="_blank"><img src="images/gcwf-beards.gif" alt="Inside the Design Studio" width="468" height="128" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">02/21/08</div>
  <p>Why make new cartoons when you probably haven't even seen the old ones?
    Well, that's the case for this week's Treat. Not lack of enthusiasm or ideas
    but lack of time is the case for this installment. So enjoy this collection
    of &quot;oldie
    but goodie&quot; <a href="http://www.nickvolkert.com/syndication/index.htm" target="_blank">Gone
    Clean, Wholesome Fun</a> comics. Just think of it as a re-run of your favorite
    show. </p>
      <h2>Valentines 2008. Yup. Deal With It. </h2>
      <a href="valentines_08/index.html"><img src="images/v08.gif" alt="Inside the Design Studio" width="468" height="127" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">02/14/08</div>
  <p>&quot;Singles Awareness Day&quot;, &quot;Valentines Day&quot;, or whatever you want to call
    it, an exchange of cards is in order. Now it's impossible to cater to ALL
    shapes and sizes, but I try. In the meantime enjoy these half-assed valentine
    card designs for a select few peeps. <a href="valentines_08/index.html">Check
    em out here.</a> </p>
      <h2>Logos and slogans, OH MY! </h2>
      <a href="sponsors/index.html"><img src="images/sponsors-promo.jpg" alt="Inside the Design Studio" width="468" height="150" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">01/31/08</div>
  <p>Logos make the world go round. With that said, I'd thought I'd take a break
    from the usally toons and share some of my most recent logo projects. I'm
    also trying my hand at writing copy for the marketing too. <a href="sponsors/index.html">Check
    it out!!!</a></p>
      <h2>Da Terminator...s </h2>
      <a href="terminators/index.html"><img src="images/terminator.gif" alt="Beards" width="468" height="153" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">01/24/08</div>
  <p>I really like the new Terminator show, and guessing by the viewing numbers it gets, so do you. But I'm admittedly not sure on how long the show's storyline will last. So to help the cause I created my own Terminator models to hunt down John and Sarah Connor and oppress the human race. <a href="terminators/index.html">Read all about it here.</a> </p>
      <h2>Beards...</h2>
      <a href="beards/index.html"><img src="images/beards.gif" alt="Beards" width="468" height="124" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">01/16/08</div>
  <p>Since Letterman and Conan came back on the air with beards, showing solidarity
    with the writers on strike, I kind of wondered how some other of our favorite
    TV personalities would look with beards. So sit back, and let the treat dazzle
    you with an animation of them donning some beardage. You don't really care
    you say? Well by all means, <a href="beards/index.html">don't look at this!</a></p>
      <h2>The Thursday Treat is Affected by the Writer's Strike...</h2>
      <a href="writerstrike_1/index.html"><img src="images/writerstrike_0109.gif" width="468" height="96" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">01/09/08</div>
  <p>Yup, that's right, the Writer's striketh back on the Treat as well. So this
    week I provide only the visuals, but you get to think of the caption. (Keep
    it a secret, I wrote a caption without my writers, just <strong>hover
    over the image</strong>,
    shhhh, <em>it's out little secret</em>). <a href="writerstrike_1/index.html">Strike
    on here.</a> </p>
      <h2>Vote Me, This January 3rd</h2>
      <a href="volkert_2008/index.html"><img src="images/volkert_2008.gif" width="468" height="197" border="0" /></a>
      <div class="datestamp">Posted: 01/03/08</div>
        <p>Man, there's nothing I can't stand more than <strong>politics</strong>. And in 2008's presidential race there's a lion share of blow-hards and incompetant candidates. Considering basically everyone else is running, and it's my birthday, I thought, why don't I run? <a href="volkert_2008/index.html">Read up on my campaign notes here.</a> </p>
